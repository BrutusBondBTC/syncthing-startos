# iOS

Unfortunately there is currently no official Syncthing iOS app.  You can track the progress of Syncthing adding a native iOS application on their `GitHub page <https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/issues/102>`_.

There is a third party application, `Mobius Sync <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/m%C3%B6bius-sync/id1539203216>`_.  This app requires payment for full features, and is untested/unsupported by Start9 at this time.
